### Expense-tracker-app
https://track-expensee.netlify.app/
I have Build an expense tracker app "outlay".

It is simple to use first, user have to write the amount he/she has spent and then the user have to mention the item/service and then just click on ADD btn and your item will be added
if user has done some mistake he/she can delete it just by clicking on trash icon. 

user can use this for his/her houshold or commercial purpose to track their expenses, other features are also present for better experiance. 


USE n ENJOY :)
